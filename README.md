## Instructions

- The game begins when a card is clicked. Click on any card and you will see an image
- Search for the identical image in other cards.
- When you find the same image, both of them will stay opened - meaning there's a match.
- If you didn't find it, both of the images will disppear.
- Try to find identical images in as less moves as possible to get a better rating.
- Match all 16 pairs of images/cards.  Once all pairs are turned over and matched, the game ends, displaying your score.
